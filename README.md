# FitSync


# Added
 - last_sync added to account info



# TODO

Workflow for add_account:
 - get the account info (already done)
 - Ask for how many days or date or none
 - call init sync or daily sync for it
 - make just a init_sync function for a specific account

Test no custom tabs

 1. Insert last dates instead of most recent
 1. Make daily_sync_all for the scheduler
 2. Make the scheduler work (refresh once daily)
 3. send confirmation email when account created
